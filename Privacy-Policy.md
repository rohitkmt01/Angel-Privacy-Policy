# Angel Discord Music Bot - Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 24 May 2025

Angel is a Discord Music Bot designed to play music on your server. We take your privacy very seriously and want to be transparent about what information we access and how we use it.

## 1. Data We Collect

Angel does **not** collect any personal or sensitive data. However, to operate the bot, we temporarily access the following information:

- Voice channel IDs (to play music)  
- Text channel IDs (to respond to commands)  
- User IDs (to process commands and check permissions)  
- Server (Guild) IDs (for settings and preferences)  

This information is stored **temporarily in memory (RAM)** and is **not saved permanently**, except for some data stored in our database as explained below.

## 2. Data Storage and Database Usage

Angel uses a database **only** to manage:

- Badge information (to recognize special user roles or achievements)  
- Premium features (to verify premium users)  
- No-prefix mode settings (to allow commands without prefixes in specific servers)  

Other than this, Angel does **not** store any personal user data. Temporary data like music queues is cleared when the bot restarts.

If new features are added in the future requiring data storage, this policy will be updated accordingly.

## 3. How We Use Data

We use the above data only for:

- Processing music commands  
- Connecting to voice channels  
- Sending responses in text channels  
- Managing badge, premium, and no-prefix features through the database  

## 4. Third-Party Services

Angel may use third-party services like YouTube, Spotify, and SoundCloud to fetch music data. We **do not share any user data** with these services. All requests are made anonymously or server-side.

## 5. User Rights

Since Angel does not store personal data except the limited database usage mentioned above, there is nothing to delete or request regarding your data.

If you have any concerns about the botâ€™s behavior or privacy, you may:

- Remove the bot from your server  
- Contact the bot owner via the support server  

## 6. Changes to this Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally as new features are added. Major changes will be announced in the support server or update logs.
